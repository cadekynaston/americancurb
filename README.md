# American Curb
### Landscape Curbing Professionals

This is a business landing page I created for a small business. This is the first site I have created using Next.js and I found it to be a very enjoyable experience for creating a high performing website relatively easily.

This is also the first site that I actually used Figma and designed the entire thing before writing any code and I can't recommend doing that enough. I know that is obvious that you should design things before you start coding, but I always had a hard time doing it and now I won't go back. [Check it out!](https://nextjs.org/)
